+ Add explicit dependency management via event-wait-list arguments for
  all applicable utilities.  Utilities should not assume anything
  unnecessary about command queues, such as whether they are IOE or
  OOE.

  This includes adding event-wait-list arguments to the utilities and
  any functions they generate where such arguments would be
  appropriate.

+ Add suite of complex math functions, including libcerf

+ Add support for complex integration

- Add a midpoint integrator based on make-opencl-function-sampler and
  make-opencl-reducer.  Data should be generated per-job and then
  processed with the rest of the reduction algorithm, not broken into
  separate jobs that use lots of global memory.

- Add adjustable parameter support for:

  - make-opencl-mapper
