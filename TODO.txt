+ Modify RK4 so that multiple kernels can be run on the same inputs in
  parallel.  It's more efficient to have kernels submitted in parallel
  than to have one kernel conditionally branch during execution.

+ Add handlers/restarts for foreign memory cleanup.  At the moment
  OpenCL memory is easily leaked due to encountering an error, so some
  tools that assist in cleaning up memory would be useful.

- Add suite of complex math functions, including libcerf

- Add support for complex integration

- Add a midpoint integrator based on make-opencl-function-sampler and
  make-opencl-reducer.  Data should be generated per-job and then
  processed with the rest of the reduction algorithm, not broken into
  separate jobs that use lots of global memory.

- Add adjustable parameter support for:

  - make-opencl-mapper

- Add explicit dependency management via event-wait-list arguments for
  all applicable utilities.  Utilities should not assume anything
  unnecessary about command queues, such as whether they are IOE or
  OOE.

  This includes adding event-wait-list arguments to the utilities and
  any functions they generate where such arguments would be
  appropriate.
