sampling that must be set at least once.  The optional parameters are
sticky, so that once set, they maintain their value until changed.
The results will be written to out-buffer starting at out-start.
out-start defaults to 0.  The return value of the generated function
is an event that will need to be waited on and released at some point.

queue must be an OpenCL queue handle.

input-type should be a CFFI type designator.

If output-type is not specified, it is assumed to be input-type.

expr should be a Lisp function accepting one string and returning
OpenCL C code for an expression of a unary operation to apply to the
variable referenced in the string argument.  The expression can refer
to code defined in the preamble string argument or included in one of
the headers.  opencl-function-expr can be useful to generate
expressions from already-defined OpenCL C functions.

memobj is the source memory buffer.

preamble can be Lispified OpenCL C code or a string of OpenCL C code
to be placed below headers but above the reduction kernel.  Useful for
defining utility functions to call in the expression.

headers can be a list of device header file names to include in the
kernel OpenCL C code.

options can be compiler options for the OpenCL kernel.

start can be an initial index offset to start reading from the buffer.

end can be a final index offset to stop reading from the buffer.  Uses
subseq index convention, i.e. the element at index=end is not
included.

kernel and program will need to be released at some point once you're
done using the reducer."
